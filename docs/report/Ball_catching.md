# Catching the ball

Another way to see the accuracy of the methods is to observe the position where reachy taking the ball at the beginning of the throw.

## Using goal possitions

The ball is perfectly caught like in the VR movement.

## Using only current positions without correction 

The hand is too low which prevents the ball from being picked up, so it is not possible to make the throws. Without correction the arm does not compensate the weight and PIDs do not allow to reach the control explaining that the arm is too low.

## With new PIDs

New PIDs allow to sometimes catch the ball but it is very rare.

Most of the time the pids alone are not enough to bring the arm up enough to catch it. The hand is too low and therefore the ball cannot be thrown.

## With torque correction

The correction of the torque generated by the weight makes it possible to well raise and place the hand allowing him to catch the ball.

## With torque correstion and new PIDs

The correction of the torque generated by the weight allows the arm to be lifted quite high, the new PIDs increase the precision but generate a little more vibration, the arm hits the ball very lightly, which makes it fall off the support. 

To make the throws, we just need to hold the ball lightly on the support.
