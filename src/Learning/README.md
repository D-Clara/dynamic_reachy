During this project, a part of our initial goal was the creation a dataset of throws to allow reachy to generate its own thanks to machine learning

To do so we began working on a characterization of trajectories to give them to a model. We also prepared a simple convolutional model and data preparation functions.

Finally we had to abort this part of our project due to the lack of time to create such a dataset, and the problem brought by the imprecision of the robot's movements while reproducing the same trajectory, making our registration of data more complicated.
